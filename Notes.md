## Big O

* way we analyze how efficent algo's
* look for loop's, not always
* if i give more inputs, would it increase time then it increases complexity
* This is absolutely essential to know about Big O analysis. It's useless without context. If you're asked is in a situation if a O(n) or a O(n²) your answer should be "it depends" or "I need more context". If the O(n) algorithm is extremely difficult to comprehend and the O(n²) algorithm is dramatically easier to understand and performance is a total non-issue, then the O(n²) is a much better choice.

## Spatial Complexity

* In general if someone talks about Big O and doesn't specify what type they're talking about, it's usually about computational complexity, or analyzing how long something takes to run. Let's talk about spatial complexity or how much space (e.g. how much RAM or disk space) an algorithm needs to complete.
